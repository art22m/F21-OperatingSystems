There are three strategies: recovery, prevention and avoidance
Recovery: 
 - This strategy tends to kill the process, which may not be the applicable 
   for some processes. Also we should save bookmarks for rollbacks. Thus, this 
   is not the best choice.
   
Prevention:
 - This strategy works in case of the following conditions: mutual exclusion, 
   hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait. The main problem is that 
   there will be problems with parallelism.
   
Avoidance: 
 - This strategy works fine if there are exist information about the needed 
   resources. In this case, the system is able to decide whether resource is 
   safe or not.
